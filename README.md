# Math Using Neural Networks
Simple neural network from scratch using numpy. 
*Required numpy library of python

The Neural network consists of two input layers , one output layer.
Linear activation function used.
The relation between inputs in (a+b)*3, automatically learned by the network.

The second file is pattern recognition using single layer neural network. 
Sigmoid activation function used.
Pattern following :
1 1 1= 1
1 0 1= 1
0 1 1= 0

Output can only be 0 or 1. Output is 1 when first input is 1.
We will ask the network to "guess" the output of 100( i.e 1).
